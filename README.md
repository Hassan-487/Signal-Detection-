This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, consisting of 43 classes. The data is preprocessed by resizing images to 30x30 pixels, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The CNN architecture includes two convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling layers, with ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax for the output layer. The model is trained for 20 epochs and achieves an accuracy of 96.17% on the test dataset. The backend for this project is developed using Flask, providing a simple interface for deploying the trained model for predictions.

After training, the model is saved and can be loaded later for inference on new images. The performance is evaluated using the `accuracy_score` from scikit-learn. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning to classify traffic signs with high accuracy, and the model can be further improved with techniques like data augmentation or hyperparameter tuning. The Flask backend ensures easy integration for real-time traffic sign predictions through a web interface.
